<div class="blog-custom-border">
<div id="exr-" class="custom_problem theorem exercise">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Exercise 1.1</strong></span> <br></p>
<p>人口 <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> 人からなる地域Aの公衆衛生政策担当者を想定します．とある感染症が世界的に流行しており，公衆衛生担当者として全市民にワクチン接種を強制するか否かの意思決定に直面しています．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 政策意思決定に関連する情報</strong></p>
<p>政策意思決定に関連する情報として以下のことがわかっています</p>
<ul>
<li>ワクチンの費用は摂取人数あたり100円（=つまり，ワクチンを矯正すると一人あたり施策実施費用は100円，otherwise 0円）</li>
<li>健康な人の一人あたりのGDPは1000円だが，感染症に罹患すると500円まで下がる</li>
<li>感染症に罹患した人にワクチンを投与すると，一人あたりのGDPは500円→1000円まで回復する</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 仮定</strong></p>
<p>地域の住民 <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> が感染症に罹患しているか否かを表す確率変数 <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> は</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_i \overset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} \operatorname{Bernoulli}(\theta)
\]</span></p>
<p>そして，街全体の感染者人数を</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y = \sum_{i=1}^{1000} Y_i
\]</span></p>
<p>と表すとします．<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> は公衆衛生政策担当者にとっては未知であるが，事前の情報として，少し古い情報だが地域Aと似たような地域では 平均 <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>, 区間 <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span> から <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> の間で分布していることがわかっているとします．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 直面している意思決定問題</strong></p>
<p>Decision変数 <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> を以下のように表すとする</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
d = \left\{\begin{array}{c}
1 &amp; \text{ワクチン接種強制}\\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.  
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>地域Aの <span class="math inline">\(U = \text{GDP}(Y, d) - \text{施策費用}\times d\)</span> の期待値を最大化する観点から公衆衛生政策担当者は <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> をどのように決定すればよいか？</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>データに基づいて公衆衛生政策担当者の行う判断を決定(decision)とするとき，その決定は <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> という変数で上記のように表されています．このとき，決定 <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> の集合について一般に<strong>決定空間</strong>とと呼び，多くの場合 <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> で表されます．</p>
<p>問題設定より，決定空間 <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> は</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D = \{\text{住民へのワクチン接種強制実施}, \text{住民へのワクチン接種強制不実施}\}
\]</span></p>
<p>となります．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; パラメータ空間</strong></p>
<p>意思決定にあたって関心があるのは，街で感染した人の割合 <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> です．大まかに言えば，<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> のパラメーター空間 <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> は0と1の間のすべての値になるので</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Theta = [0, 1]
\]</span></p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 損失関数</strong></p>
<p>地域Aの <span class="math inline">\(U = \text{GDP} - \text{施策費用}\)</span> の期待値の最大化問題は，</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}_d\, \mathbb E[U]
    &amp;= \mathbb E[\sum_{i=1}^{1000} (\text{GDP}(Y, d)_i - 100d)]\\
    &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{1000}\mathbb E[\text{GDP}(Y_i, d)_i - 100d]\\
    &amp;= 1000 \times \mathbb E[\text{GDP}(Y_i, d)_i - 100d]
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>したがって，</p>
<p><span id="eq-objective-func"><span class="math display">\[
\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}_d\, \mathbb E[\text{GDP}_i(Y_i, d) - 100d]
\tag{1.1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>の問題を解けば良いことがわかります．最大化問題の形式でも良いですが，これを損失関数の形で表現し直します．このとき， <span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> を成分とする損失行列 <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> は</p>

<p>以上のように <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb E[\theta\vert X]\)</span> は解析解と近しい結果が出力されます． また，<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb E[\theta\vert X] &gt; 0.2\)</span> となるので，事後分布に基づく政策意思決定として，<span class="math inline">\(d = 1\)</span>, つまりワクチン接種強制という結論が導かれることになります．</p>
