<p>人口 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1000"> 人からなる地域Aの公衆衛生政策担当者を想定します．とある感染症が世界的に流行しており，公衆衛生担当者として全市民にワクチン接種を強制するか否かの意思決定に直面しています．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 政策意思決定に関連する情報</strong></p>
<p>政策意思決定に関連する情報として以下のことがわかっています</p>
<ul>
<li>ワクチンの費用は摂取人数あたり100円（=つまり，ワクチンを矯正すると一人あたり施策実施費用は100円，otherwise 0円）</li>
<li>健康な人の一人あたりのGDPは1000円だが，感染症に罹患すると500円まで下がる</li>
<li>感染症に罹患した人にワクチンを投与すると，一人あたりのGDPは500円→1000円まで回復する</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 仮定</strong></p>
<p>地域の住民 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> が感染症に罹患しているか否かを表す確率変数 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_i"> は</p>

<p>そして，街全体の感染者人数を</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AY%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7B1000%7D%20Y_i%0A"></p>
<p>と表すとします．<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> は公衆衛生政策担当者にとっては未知であるが，事前の情報として，少し古い情報だが地域Aと似たような地域では 平均 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.1">, 区間 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.01"> から <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.25"> の間で分布していることがわかっているとします．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 直面している意思決定問題</strong></p>
<p>Decision変数 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> を以下のように表すとする</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ad%20=%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%0A1%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7B%E3%83%AF%E3%82%AF%E3%83%81%E3%83%B3%E6%8E%A5%E7%A8%AE%E5%BC%B7%E5%88%B6%7D%5C%5C%0A0%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D%0A%5Cend%7Barray%7D%5Cright.%20%20%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D%0A"></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>データに基づいて公衆衛生政策担当者の行う判断を決定(decision)とするとき，その決定は <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> という変数で上記のように表されています．このとき，決定 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> の集合について一般に<strong>決定空間</strong>とと呼び，多くの場合 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> で表されます．</p>
<p>問題設定より，決定空間 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> は</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AD%20=%20%5C%7B%5Ctext%7B%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E3%81%B8%E3%81%AE%E3%83%AF%E3%82%AF%E3%83%81%E3%83%B3%E6%8E%A5%E7%A8%AE%E5%BC%B7%E5%88%B6%E5%AE%9F%E6%96%BD%7D,%20%5Ctext%7B%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E3%81%B8%E3%81%AE%E3%83%AF%E3%82%AF%E3%83%81%E3%83%B3%E6%8E%A5%E7%A8%AE%E5%BC%B7%E5%88%B6%E4%B8%8D%E5%AE%9F%E6%96%BD%7D%5C%7D%0A"></p>
<p>となります．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; パラメータ空間</strong></p>
<p>意思決定にあたって関心があるのは，街で感染した人の割合 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> です．大まかに言えば，<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> のパラメーター空間 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CTheta"> は0と1の間のすべての値になるので</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CTheta%20=%20%5B0,%201%5D%0A"></p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 損失関数</strong></p>
<p>地域Aの <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U%20=%20%5Ctext%7BGDP%7D%20-%20%5Ctext%7B%E6%96%BD%E7%AD%96%E8%B2%BB%E7%94%A8%7D"> の期待値の最大化問題は，</p>

<p>したがって，</p>

<p>の問題を解けば良いことがわかります．最大化問題の形式でも良いですが，これを損失関数の形で表現し直します．このとき， <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_%7Bij%7D"> を成分とする損失行列 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> は</p>

<p>以上のように <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%20E%5B%5Ctheta%5Cvert%20X%5D"> は解析解と近しい結果が出力されます． また，<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%20E%5B%5Ctheta%5Cvert%20X%5D%20%3E%200.2"> となるので，事後分布に基づく政策意思決定として，<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%20=%201">, つまりワクチン接種強制という結論が導かれることになります．</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ベイズ法の考え方">ベイズ法の考え方</h2>
<p>ある集団の特性がパラメーター <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> として表現されるとします．集団の一部についてデータ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> が観測されたとき， その <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> からの情報はパラメーター <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> についての不確実性(uncertainty)を減らすことになります． ベイズ推測(Bayesian inference)とはこの不確実性の変化を測ることが直接的な目的となります．</p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; 事前分布と事後分布</strong></p>
<p>標本空間 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BY%7D">, パラメーター空間 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CTheta"> としたとき，ベイズ学習は <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y,%20%5Ctheta"> に関する信念を <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BY%7D"> と <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CTheta"> の確率分布によって表現するところから始まります．</p>
<p>まず，<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta%5Cin%5CTheta"> について事前分布 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta)"> を設定します． <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta)"> は，<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> が母集団の真の特性を表すとどれだけ分析者が信じているか？を表していると解釈できます．</p>
<p>データ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> が観測された後，ベイズルールに従って <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> に関する信念を更新します．このとき現れるのが事後分布 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%5Cvert%20y)"> ですが，これはデータ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> が観測された後に <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> が真の値であるとどれだけ信じているかを表すことに対応しています．</p>
<div class="blog-custom-border">
<p><strong>Def: 確率(probability)</strong> <br></p>
<p>ベイズ法における確率(probability) は，未知の量について人々の持つ情報や信念(belief)を表すものと解釈される．</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong> ▶&nbsp; ベイズルール</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Ctheta%5Cvert%20y)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(y%5Cvert%20%5Ctheta)p(%5Ctheta)%7D%7B%5Cint_%7B%5CTheta%7Dp(y%5Cvert%20%5Ctilde%5Ctheta)p(%5Ctilde%5Ctheta)%5C,%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%5Ctilde%5Ctheta%7D%0A"></p>
<p>ベイズルールが示している内容は．事後分布がどうあるべきかではなく，<strong>新たな情報を得たときに事後分布はどう変化すべきか？</strong>です．</p>
